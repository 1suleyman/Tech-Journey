Hey everyone 👋

If you're diving into **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and want to build cloud infrastructure **the smart, repeatable way** — then welcome!

This repo is where I’m collecting all the blog-style breakdowns and notes from my study journey toward the **HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate** exam.

Think of it as my personal **learning vault**, but also a resource for anyone who’s tired of vague docs and wants real talk, simple explanations, and analogies that actually *make sense*.

Whether you're brand new to Terraform or brushing up for the cert, I hope these notes help you "get it" — not just memorize it 👇

## 📚 Blog Posts / Learning Notes

> Each post breaks down Terraform concepts in plain English, using analogies, examples, and visuals when it helps. Here’s the learning path I’m following:

1. [🛠️ What Can You Actually Do With Terraform? (And Why It’s a Game-Changer for Cloud Teams)](https://dev.to/1suleyman/what-can-you-actually-do-with-terraform-and-why-its-a-game-changer-for-cloud-teams-fk2)

## 💻 Hands-On Lab Project: Terraform-Powered Cloud Infrastructure (Coming Soon)

Alongside the study notes, I’m building a real-world IaC project using Terraform.

This hands-on lab walks through setting up a simple yet powerful infrastructure — fully deployed with Terraform. Think of it as my capstone project to tie everything together.

### 🌐 Project Use Case
Deploy a **web app backend** on **AWS** using:
- VPC with public/private subnets
- EC2 instances
- Security groups
- S3 bucket
- IAM roles
- (Optional) RDS, Auto Scaling, or Load Balancer

| Terraform Init + AWS Provider Setup | ❌ | _To be completed_ |
| VPC and Networking Resources | ❌ | _To be completed_ |
| EC2 + Security Groups | ❌ | _To be completed_ |
| S3 Bucket with Lifecycle Rules | ❌ | _To be completed_ |
| Output Variables & Remote State | ❌ | _To be completed_ |

## 🧠 Why I’m Doing This

Learning Terraform felt intimidating at first — especially with all the new terms like state locking, providers, backends, and HCL syntax.

So I decided to:
- Teach Terraform as I learn it — in my own words
- Break it down in plain English, with simple analogies
- Make the learning journey public to help others & keep myself accountable
