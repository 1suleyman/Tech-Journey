Hey everyone 👋

If you're diving into **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and want to build cloud infrastructure **the smart, repeatable way** — then welcome!

This repo is where I’m collecting all the blog-style breakdowns and notes from my study journey toward the **HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate** exam.

Think of it as my personal **learning vault**, but also a resource for anyone who’s tired of vague docs and wants real talk, simple explanations, and analogies that actually *make sense*.

Whether you're brand new to Terraform or brushing up for the cert, I hope these notes help you "get it" — not just memorize it 👇

## 💻 Hands-On Lab Project: Terraform-Powered 3-Tier Employee Directory

Alongside the study notes, I’m building a **real-world Infrastructure as Code (IaC) project** using Terraform.
This project provisions a **3-Tier Employee Directory Web Application** on AWS — fully automated via `.tf` files.

Think of this as my **capstone Terraform project**: not just theory, but applied end-to-end with real debugging, pivots, and lessons learned.

---

## 🌐 Project Use Case

Deploy a production-style web application on AWS using:

* **VPC** with public/private subnets
* **EC2** instances for compute (Flask + test web server)
* **IAM** roles and policies for least-privilege access
* **S3** for storing employee profile photos
* **DynamoDB** for storing employee data
* **Security groups** for tight traffic control
* (Planned) **Load Balancer + Auto Scaling** for HA
* (Planned) **API Gateway + Lambda** for serverless features

## 📋 Project Breakdown

| 📦 Section                                 | ✅ Status    | 📎 Notes                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Module 0: Remote State (Bootstrap)**     | ✅ Completed | Created S3 bucket (`tf-state-employee-directory`) + DynamoDB table (`tf-state-locks`) manually. Verified backend config via `terraform init`.                                  |
| **Module 1: IAM Setup + Provider Config**  | ✅ Completed | Added provider defaults (tags, region). Created `AdminUser`, `DevUser`, `EC2Admins` group, and `EmployeeWebAppRole`. Used workspaces for `dev`/`prod`.                         |
| **Module 2: EC2 Deployment**               | ✅ Completed | Provisioned `t2.micro` with IAM profile + SG. Debugged subnet, IGW, and user\_data issues. Validated with static Apache page → `🎉 Hello from EC2!`.                           |
| **Module 3: VPC & Networking**             | ✅ Completed | Built custom VPC `10.1.0.0/16` with 2 AZs, public/private subnets, IGW + route tables. Verified connectivity with EC2 test.                                                    |
| **Module 4: S3 Storage Integration**       | ⚠️ Paused   | Created bucket `employee-photo-bucket-456s` with policy for EC2 role. Ran into Flask `user_data` script issues (yum vs dnf, port binding). Paused here to pivot learning time. |
| **Module 5: DynamoDB Integration**         | ⏳ Planned   | Create `Employees` table. Connect app via env variables. Validate end-to-end CRUD.                                                                                             |
| **Module 6: Load Balancer + Auto Scaling** | ⏳ Planned   | Add ALB with target groups + ASG scaling policies. Test CPU stress scaling.                                                                                                    |
| **Module 7: Serverless Extension**         | ⏳ Planned   | API Gateway + Lambda function for contact form. Deploy as add-on service.                                                                                                      |
| **Final Testing + Destroy Plan**           | ⏳ Planned   | Validate app end-to-end, snapshot final state, `terraform destroy` cleanup.                                                                                                    |

## 📝 Logging Format

For each module, I capture:

* **Planned approach**
* **Executed Terraform code + screenshots**
* **Gotchas & fixes** (real debugging notes)
* **Lessons learned**

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

This isn’t just about “getting Terraform working.”
It’s about:

* Practicing **real DevOps workflows** (IaC, version control, repeatable builds).
* Documenting **debug pivots** (route blackholes, public IPs, yum vs dnf, etc.).
* Building an **exam-ready foundation** for Terraform Associate.
* Preparing for **real-world cloud engineer tasks** like HA networking, IAM least privilege, and scalable app design.

## 🧠 Why I’m Doing This

Learning Terraform felt intimidating at first — especially with all the new terms like state locking, providers, backends, and HCL syntax.

So I decided to:
- Teach Terraform as I learn it — in my own words
- Break it down in plain English, with simple analogies
- Make the learning journey public to help others & keep myself accountable
