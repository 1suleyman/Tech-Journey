# ⚡ Terraform Projects

Welcome to my **Terraform Projects** folder!  

Here, I document everything I’ve done with **Terraform** — from hands-on infrastructure deployments to study notes for the HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate exam — so you can follow along, learn from real examples, or get inspired to try your own **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** projects.
