# ☁️ AWS Projects

Welcome to my **AWS Projects** folder!  

Here, I document everything I’ve done in **AWS** — from hands-on projects to labs — so you can follow along, learn from real examples, or just get inspired to try your own cloud projects.

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

This folder contains all of my AWS-related **projects and labs**, organized by practical use case and learning objective.

## 🗂️ Projects & Hands-On Labs

- **[🧑‍💻 AWS 3-Tier Employee Directory Web Application](https://github.com/1suleyman/-AWS-Employee-Directory-Project-Hands-On-Lab-)**  
  A full-stack web app featuring EC2, S3, DynamoDB, VPC, IAM roles, Load Balancer, and Auto Scaling.

- **[🌌 Hosting My Space Invaders Game on Amazon S3](https://github.com/1suleyman/-Hosting-a-Space-Invaders-Game-on-Amazon-S3)**  
  A static website deployment on S3 with public hosting and CloudFront integration(coming soon).

- **[📊 Netflix Data Visualizations with Amazon QuickSight](https://github.com/1suleyman/-Netflix-Data-Visualizations-with-Amazon-QuickSight)**  
  Analyzing datasets stored in S3 and creating interactive visual dashboards.

- **[🛡️ AWS IAM Hands-On Lab: NextWork Intern Onboarding](https://github.com/1suleyman/-AWS-IAM-Hands-On-Lab-NextWork-Intern-Onboarding/blob/main/README.md)**  
  Onboarding new intern onto AWS environment while securely managing access to development and production resources.

### Networking Series

* **[🌐 My AWS VPC, Subnet, and Internet Gateway Hands-On Lab](https://github.com/1suleyman/-AWS-VPC-Subnet-and-Internet-Gateway-Hands-On-Lab-/tree/main)**
  Creating a VPC, configuring subnets, and attaching an internet gateway to connect resources to the internet. (Part 1 in the networking series)

* **[🌐 My AWS Public Subnet, Route Table, Security Group, and Network ACL Hands-On Lab](https://github.com/1suleyman/-AWS-public-subnet-route-table-security-group-and-network-ACL-Hands-On-Lab/tree/main)**
  Creating a secure VPC on AWS with a public subnet, route table, security group, and network ACL. (Part 2 in the networking series)

* **[🌐 My AWS EC2 Launch Lab with Public and Private Subnets](https://github.com/1suleyman/-My-AWS-EC2-Launch-Lab-with-Public-and-Private-Subnets/blob/main/README.md)**
  For Part 4, I temporarily switched back to the AWS Console to explore the **VPC resource map diagram**, which visually shows the relationships between public/private subnets, route tables, and internet gateways.
  This hands-on console walkthrough helped me understand how all components interact. After completing this, I am now **resuming Terraform** to automate EC2 deployment and any remaining networking tasks.

**🔄 Note**: After Part 2, I initially pivoted fully to [Terraform only](https://github.com/1suleyman/Tech-Journey/blob/main/Terraform/Terraform%20Projects.md) for the labs. Part 4 was a brief exception to get a visual overview of the VPC. All future networking projects will now continue **100% via Terraform**, keeping everything reproducible, scalable, and aligned with industry best practices.
