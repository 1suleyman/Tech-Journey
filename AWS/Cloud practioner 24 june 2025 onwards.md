Hey everyone 👋

If you're diving into cloud for the first time — especially through AWS — then welcome! This repo is where I’m collecting all the blog posts I’ve written while studying for the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** exam.

Think of it like my personal bank of notes — but also a public learning vault for anyone else who wants real talk, simple explanations, and analogies that *actually* make sense.

Whether you're a complete beginner or brushing up for the exam, I hope these posts help break things down the way I wish someone had for me 👇

## 🛠️ NEW: AWS Hands-On Project  
Alongside the blog posts, I’m now building a **real cloud project** — a secure employee directory application hosted on AWS.

This section documents my full journey through a guided lab project (6 modules total). Each module teaches real services like IAM, EC2, S3, DynamoDB, VPC, Load Balancing, and more — with step-by-step tasks so I can eventually rebuild the project from scratch 💪

## 🧠 Why I’m Doing This

Studying for certifications can feel overwhelming — especially if you’re not from a tech background.

I started this blog series to:
- Make cloud concepts easier to understand.
- Share notes in a way that *actually* sticks.
- Keep myself accountable while learning.

If any of these help you on your journey, that’s a win in my book 🙌

Stay tuned — and feel free to submit suggestions!
