Hey everyone 👋

If you're diving into cloud for the first time — especially through AWS — then welcome! This repo is where I’m collecting all the blog posts I’ve written while studying for the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** exam.

Think of it like my personal bank of notes — but also a public learning vault for anyone else who wants real talk, simple explanations, and analogies that *actually* make sense.

Whether you're a complete beginner or brushing up for the exam, I hope these posts help break things down the way I wish someone had for me 👇

## 🛠️ AWS 3-Tier Employee Directory Web Application (Hands-On Lab)

Alongside the blog posts, I’m also building a **real-world cloud project** — a secure, scalable **Employee Directory Web Application** hosted fully on AWS.

This hands-on lab walks through the end-to-end setup of a 3-tier architecture, using core AWS services like:

- **IAM** for access control  
- **EC2** for compute  
- **S3** for storing profile images  
- **DynamoDB** for employee records  
- **VPC** for custom networking  
- **Elastic Load Balancing** for traffic routing  
- **EC2 Auto Scaling** for fault tolerance and scalability  
- [Coming soon] **API Gateway + Lambda** for a serverless contact form  

🧱 Think of it as my personal "capstone" project for mastering AWS fundamentals.
