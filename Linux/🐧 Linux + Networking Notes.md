# 🐧 Linux + Networking Notes – The Foundation of Cloud & DevOps

Hey everyone 👋

If you're getting into **cloud**, **DevOps**, **cybersecurity**, or just want to feel more confident in the terminal — you're in the right place.

This repo is where I’m collecting my notes, mini-labs, and real-world examples as I study Linux fundamentals and core networking concepts. Think of it as my personal cheat sheet — but also a public resource for anyone who wants **clear explanations**, **hands-on examples**, and **command-line confidence**.

Whether you're a beginner or brushing up, I hope this repo helps you “get it” — not just memorize it 👇

## 🔁 Why I’m Doing This

When I started learning Linux and networking, it felt like everything was written for people who were already experts.

So I built this repo to:

- Make terminal work and networking *click* for beginners  
- Build a personal study guide I can reuse  
- Share my learning in public to help others too  

---

## 🔧 Coming Soon...

I'm planning to add:

- Bash scripting projects  
- Visual breakdowns of OSI layers and subnetting  
- SSH configuration and key management  
- Common Linux interview tasks & networking CLI challenges
