## 📌 Why I'm Doing This

I wanted a space where I could:

* Document what I’m learning in a way that actually makes sense to *me*
* Break down complex topics with analogies and real examples
* Keep everything version-controlled and easy to update
* Share the journey publicly in case it helps someone else 👇

---

## 🗂️ What's Next?

Soon I’ll be adding new folders and content for:

* **PowerShell**
