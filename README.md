# üíª Tech-Journey

Hey everyone üëã

Welcome to **Tech-Journey** ‚Äî this is where I document my personal deep-dive into the world of tech, one project and one blog post at a time. Whether you‚Äôre just getting started, prepping for certifications, or building

This repo is organized by topic ‚Äî each folder contains blog-style breakdowns, mini-labs, and notes from my study journey.

## üìå Why I'm Doing This

I wanted a space where I could:

* Document what I‚Äôm learning in a way that actually makes sense to *me*
* Break down complex topics with analogies and real examples
* Keep everything version-controlled and easy to update
* Share the journey publicly in case it helps someone else üëá

---

## üóÇÔ∏è What's Next?

Soon I‚Äôll be adding new folders and content for:

* **PowerShell**
* **CI/CD with GitHub Actions & Pipelines**
