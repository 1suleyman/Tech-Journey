Hey everyone 👋

Welcome to **Tech-Journey** — this is where I document my personal deep-dive into the world of tech, one project and one blog post at a time.

Whether you’re just getting started, prepping for certifications, or building up your portfolio — I hope this repo can serve as a helpful companion or even a spark of motivation 🔥

## 📌 Why I'm Doing This

I wanted a space where I could:

- Document what I’m learning in a way that actually makes sense to *me*
- Break down complex topics with analogies and real examples
- Keep everything version-controlled and easy to update
- Share the journey publicly in case it helps someone else 👇

## 🗂️ What's Next?

Soon I’ll be adding new folders and content for:

- **Networking Basics**
- **Powershell**
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions & Pipelines**
